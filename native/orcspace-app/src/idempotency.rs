//! Remembering what a retried command already answered.
//!
//! Mirrors src/main/core/idempotency.ts. An agent that retries after a dropped
//! connection must get the first answer back, not run the command twice — so a
//! replayed result is marked `cached` and the handler is never re-entered.
//!
//! The TypeScript tracks an in-flight Promise so a retry arriving *during* the
//! first run joins it rather than starting a second. Rust has no promise to
//! hand back here, so the same state is modelled as a `Pending` marker: callers
//! see that the key is already being worked on and can decide to wait or refuse,
//! and — importantly for parity — pruning still refuses to evict it.
