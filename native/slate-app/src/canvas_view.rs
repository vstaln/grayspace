//! The infinite canvas — the actual Slate UI, replacing the tab-strip
//! placeholder. Widgets live at world coordinates under a pannable/zoomable
//! camera; everything mutates through the journal so a relaunch restores the
//! layout. Geometry comes from `canvas.rs`, state reduction from
//! `projection.rs`, colours from `theme.rs` — all ports of the Electron
//! renderer's `canvasState.ts`/`canvasLayout.ts`/`tokens.ts`.
